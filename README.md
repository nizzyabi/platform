# Nizzyabi.com

Nizzyabi.com is a Programming Course Platform for self-taught developers who want to improve their web development skills.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test, and push:

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or any other package manager)

Note: In case you use another package manager, research the equivalent commands for your package manager.

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running.

Installing modules and dependencies:

    npm install --save-dev

Running the local development server:

    npm run dev

You should now be able to see the project up and running at http://localhost:3000/.

## Running the tests

These steps ensure you are doing everything correctly and stay within structure.

### Style test

Check if the best practices and the right coding format have been used:

    npm run check
    or
    npx prettier . --check

If the command before succeeds, you should see something similar to this:

    Checking formatting...
    All matched files use Prettier code style!

If that is not the case, you can adjust your code to match the project's code format. For that simply run:

    npm run format
    or
    npx prettier . --write
